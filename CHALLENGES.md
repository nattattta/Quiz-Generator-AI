# Development Stages

## Initial Planning and Architecture Design

- Conceptualizing the multi-format quiz generator
- Designing the modular architecture (main.py, quiz_engine.py, utils.py)
- Researching APIs and libraries needed

## Core Functionality Implementation

- Setting up OpenAI API integration for GPT and Whisper
- Creating the quiz generation engine
- Implementing the quiz interface and scoring system

## Multi-format Support Development

- Text file processing
- PDF extraction capability
- Audio transcription integration
- Video processing with audio extraction

## Output and Persistence Implementation

- Quiz output formatting
- File saving functionality with timestamped naming
- Creation of output directory structure

## Testing and Refinement

- Testing with different content types
- Refining prompt engineering for better quiz questions

# Challenges and Difficulties

## Media Processing

- Setting up FFmpeg integration for audio extraction from videos
- Ensuring cross-platform compatibility for media processing
- Handling large media files and processing time

## Prompt Engineering

- Crafting effective prompts to generate high-quality multiple-choice questions
- Ensuring consistent output format from GPT for parsing
- Balancing question difficulty and relevance to source material

## Error Handling

- Implementing robust error handling for file access issues
- Handling FFmpeg failures gracefully
- Managing API errors and timeouts

## Performance Optimization

- Handling potentially large input files (especially videos and PDFs)
- Managing memory usage during transcription and processing
- Optimizing response times for better user experience

## Content Parsing

- Extracting clean, usable text from PDFs (which can have complex layouts)
- Processing audio transcription results which might contain errors
- Handling different text encodings and special characters

## Documentation

- Creating comprehensive README documentation
- Providing clear installation and usage instructions
- Explaining the project architecture and workflow
